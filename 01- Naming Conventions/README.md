#  ðŸŸ© Naming conventions
Naming things (= `variables, properties, functions, methods, classes`) correctly and in an
understandable way is an extremely important part of writing clean code.

>### Name must be meaningful


## Be Descriptive

Names have one simple purpose: They should describe what's stored in a variable or
property or what a function or method does. Or what kind of object will be created when
instantiating a class.
If you keep that in mind, coming up with good names should actually be straightforward  though coming up with the best name for a given variable/ property/ function/ ... will of
course still require some practice and often multiple iterations. 

Some standard naming rules & principles:
1. Assign Meaningful Names
2. Use Intention-Revealing Names
3. Consistency of naming styles
4. Use Pronounceable Names
5. Avoid abbreviations


## ðŸŸ¢ Some popular Naming Case

**1.CamelCase:**

Usage: Commonly used for naming variables, functions, and methods in languages like JavaScript, Java, C#, and Ruby.


**2. PascalCase:**

Usage: Frequently used for naming classes, interfaces, and sometimes methods in languages like Java, C#, and TypeScript.

**3. snake_case:**

Usage: Commonly used for naming variables, functions, and modules in languages like Python and Ruby.

**4. UPPERCASE:**

Usage: Often used for naming constants and global variables across various programming languages.


**5. lowercase:**

Usage: Generally used for naming variables, functions, and methods in many programming languages.

Code Example:

```javascript
//  CamelCase
numberOfStudents = 100
totalScoreOfStudents = 950

//  PascalCase
TotalNumberOfStudents = 100
AverageScoreOfStudents = 95.0

//  snake_case
number_of_students = 100
total_score_of_students = 950

// # kebab-case (not commonly used in programming languages like Python)
// # This is typically used in URLs or file names.
// # Example: file-name.txt, url-path-example
// # Python doesn't typically use this convention for variable names.
